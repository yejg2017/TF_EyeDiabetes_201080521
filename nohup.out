WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/ye/user/yejg/LEARN/DL_MODEL_LEARN/TensorFlow/CNN/Vgg16_DR/vgg16.py:92: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.
