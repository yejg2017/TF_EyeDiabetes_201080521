/home/ye/user/yejg/SW_DATA/Or/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/cross_validation.py:41: DeprecationWarning: This module was deprecated in version 0.18 in favor of the model_selection module into which all the refactored classes and functions are moved. Also note that the interface of the new CV iterators are different from that of this module. This module will be removed in 0.20.

WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/ye/user/yejg/LEARN/DL_MODEL_LEARN/TensorFlow/CNN/Vgg16_DR/vgg16.py:92: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.
